        <p>The Philippines, officially known as the Republic of the Philippines, is an archipelagic country in Southeast
            Asia. It consists of about 7,641 islands and is divided into three main geographical divisions:
            Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city is Manila, while the most populous city is Quezon City, both
            located in the National Capital Region (Metro Manila).

        </p>
        <p>My favorite place in the Philippines is Vigan City, located in the province of Ilocos Sur. Vigan is renowned
            for its
            well-preserved Spanish colonial and Asian architecture, which has earned it a designation as a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site. The city's cobblestone streets, historic buildings, and traditional houses (known as "Bahay
            na Bato") reflect its rich cultural heritage and history. Vigan is also famous for its vibrant local
            culture,
            delicious cuisine, and traditional crafts, making it a popular destination for both local and international
            tourists.
